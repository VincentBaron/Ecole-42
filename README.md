# Ecole-42

This Folder contains and tracks all my progress during my studies at "Ecole 42" in Paris. The projects are in order as follows:

1. Libft

Creating a library with all functions that will be frequently needed during projects so I don't have to coe them again everytime.

2. Printf

Recoding the printf function defined in the C <stdio.h> library.
